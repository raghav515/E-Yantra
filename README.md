<h2 align="center"> Theme Details</h2>
<p align="center">Tackling challenges in mobility is of the utmost importance for a city to become “Smart”. Many industries began using home delivery through the years as a way to enhance their services. However, this technique necessitates the use of labour as well as a vehicle, which increases fuel consumption. What if we sent robots to your door to bring medicines?
In the "Pharma Bot" theme, we attempt to address this issue by building autonomous delivery robots that "pick up" medicine packets from pharmacies and distribute them across our "Smart city" arena.
